# HackMIT2021

For my project, my goal was to learn more about Python and its functionality and find data that was representative of both sustainability and human health. As a resource, I referred to Python Crash Course 2nd ed. by Eric Matthes and the project from chapter 16 entitled "Downloading Data" regarding earthquake geoJSON files.  In the 10 hours I took to complete this project, I learned how all the little pieces of Python's syntax and libraries come together to automate data modeling. Although the example I followed focuses on seismic data across our planet, I was hoping to repurpose it to model wildfire data to get an inside look at how fire maps are generated. Unfortunately, I did not realize I needed to apply for the geoJSON file from NASA's website. For future work, I would change my project to reflect that original vision. Also, instead of having plotly model data offline, I would like to find other online databases to pull from to do some real-time data modeling. Overall, I enjoyed getting the opportunity to learn more about Python and data modeling.  Although earthquakes were not my original focus, they do lead to the displacement of communities and other natural disasters. My future hope for this project's code is for other learners interested in data modeling to better themselves and fulfill their needs in their respective fields of interest by using this example. MIT's Plotly is beyond excellent and a crucial tool for the future success of humanity.
